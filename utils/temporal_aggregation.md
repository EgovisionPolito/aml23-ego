# Steps
In PyTorch, to aggregate extracted features stored as `.pkl` files along the temporal axis, a possible approach:

1. **Load the Data**: Use `pickle` to load your `.pkl` files into PyTorch tensors.

2. **Create a Dataset**:  Organize these tensors into a `Dataset`

        <summary> Point 2 details </summary>

    To convert data from a pickle (pkl) file into a PyTorch dataset, it is necessary to define a custom dataset class that extends `torch.utils.data.Dataset`:

    1. **Assuming Data loaded from Pickle File**

    2. **Define Custom Dataset Class:**
    - Create a custom dataset class that extends `torch.utils.data.Dataset`.
    - Implement the `__init__`, `__len__`, and `__getitem__` methods.

    3. **Implement Dataset Methods:**
    - In the `__init__` method, store the loaded data and perform any necessary preprocessing.
    - In the `__len__` method, return the total number of samples in your dataset.
    - In the `__getitem__` method, retrieve and return a specific sample from the dataset.

    The `__getitem__` method is where you'll perform any necessary preprocessing or data transformation based on your specific requirements.

3. **Define a Model**:
   Create a PyTorch model that includes layers like `nn.Conv1d` or `nn.AvgPool1d` for temporal aggregation.

4. **Feed Data Through Model**:
   Pass your loaded data through the model. The convolutional or pooling layers will aggregate features across the temporal dimension.

Remember to ensure your data dimensions align with the input requirements of the layers you're using (e.g., `nn.Conv1d` expects `(batch, channels, length)`).

# Best practices
In PyTorch, while a simple model with just an `nn.Conv1d` layer can perform temporal aggregation, best practice usually involves a more structured model to effectively learn from the data. A typical approach includes:

1. **Conv1d Layer**: To aggregate temporal features. The number of input channels should match the feature dimension of your data.
2. **Activation Function**: Like ReLU, to introduce non-linearity.

Other option:
1. **Pooling Layer**: (Alternative) To downsample the output of the convolutional layer.

# Implementation
To use the `data` object (considering data as the object where the file .pkl is extracted) for temporal aggregation in PyTorch:

1. **Extract Features**: Loop through your `data['features']` list and stack the `'features_RGB'` numpy arrays into a PyTorch tensor. Ensure the tensor shape aligns with what `nn.Conv1d` expects.

2. **Create Dataset**: Wrap your tensor in a custom Dataset class.

3. **Define Model**: Create a PyTorch model with layers like `nn.Conv1d`, activation functions, (optional) pooling layers.

Note: adjust parameters, shapes, and layers according to your specific requirements and the structure of your data.
