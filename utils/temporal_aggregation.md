Considering a pyTorch context, having a folder with fles pkl where extracted features are stored, how can I
achieve this goal of aggregate them along a temporal axis?
In PyTorch, to aggregate extracted features stored as .pkl files along the temporal axis, you could:

# Steps
In PyTorch, to aggregate extracted features stored as `.pkl` files along the temporal axis, you could:

1. **Load the Data**:
   Use `pickle` to load your `.pkl` files into PyTorch tensors.

2. **Create a DataLoader**:
   Organize these tensors into a `Dataset` and use a `DataLoader` to batch and shuffle the data if necessary.

3. **Define a Model**:
   Create a PyTorch model that includes layers like `nn.Conv1d` or `nn.MaxPool1d` for temporal aggregation.

4. **Feed Data Through Model**:
   Pass your loaded data through the model. The convolutional or pooling layers will aggregate features across the temporal dimension.

Remember to ensure your data dimensions align with the input requirements of the layers you're using (e.g., `nn.Conv1d` expects `(batch, channels, length)`).

# Best practices
In PyTorch, while a simple model with just an `nn.Conv1d` layer can perform temporal aggregation, best practice usually involves a more structured model to effectively learn from the data. A typical approach includes:

1. **Conv1d Layer**: To aggregate temporal features. The number of input channels should match the feature dimension of your data.
2. **Activation Function**: Like ReLU, to introduce non-linearity.
3. **Pooling Layer**: (Optional) To downsample the output of the convolutional layer.
4. **Fully Connected Layers**: To map the aggregated features to the desired output size, typically ending with a classification or regression layer.

The complexity of the model should align with the complexity of your task and the amount of available data to prevent overfitting.

# Implementation
To use the `data` object (considering data as the object where the file .pkl is extracted) for temporal aggregation in PyTorch:

1. **Extract Features**: Loop through your `data['features']` list and stack the `'features_RGB'` numpy arrays into a PyTorch tensor. Ensure the tensor shape aligns with what `nn.Conv1d` expects.

2. **Create Dataset and DataLoader**: Wrap your tensor in a custom Dataset class and use a DataLoader for batching.

3. **Define Model**: Create a PyTorch model with layers like `nn.Conv1d`, activation functions, (optional) pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

4. **Training**: Train your model using the DataLoader, by feeding batches of data into your model and updating the model's weights based on the loss between the output and your ground truth.

Here's a high-level structure to implement the above steps:
```python
class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = ... # convert your data['features'] to the correct tensor shape
        
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)
    
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx]
        
class TemporalModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(TemporalModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv1d = nn.Conv1d(...) # define your layers
        # add more layers if needed
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1d(x)
        # pass through more layers
        return x

# Load data
data = ... # your loaded data
dataset = MyDataset(data)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Model
model = TemporalModel()

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        output = model(batch)
        # compute loss, backpropagate, update model weights
```

Remember to adjust parameters, shapes, and layers according to your specific requirements and the structure of your data.
